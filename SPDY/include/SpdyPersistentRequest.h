/*
 * This class provides a high level interface to a spdy implementation of 
 * an ios 'voip' persistent socket.
 *
 * This class should not be used with servers / urls which do not have the following
 * semantics:
 *
 * - uses SPDY
 * - uses HTTP GET
 * - provides the content-length header
 * - leaves the stream open after the response has been sent
 *
 * In addition, the server should support push.  If a push is received,
 * the pushSuccessCallback (declared in SpdyUrl) will be invoked.
 *
 * This class handles keepalive and reconnect details.  It provides an 
 * errorCallback for the SpdyRequest superclass which will attempt to 
 * reconnect on non-fatal errors.  In the event of a fatal error, 
 * the fatalErrorCallback is instead invoked.
